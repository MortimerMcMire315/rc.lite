"Lite" version of [my configs](https://github.com/MortimerMcMire315/rc) for use when hopping around on servers. I removed anything 256-color-related, because it's usually not worth the time to set up on anything other than my personal machine.

To install, simply:
    . install.sh
(I suggest sourcing it to immediately reload your bashrc.)
